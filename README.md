# Cover Letter Editor

This is a simple python script that reads a generator file and edits out the company_name and the position you are applying to, and creates a new cover letter. Cos let's face it, we all are lazy at times and we recycle old cover letters. Not advisable, but you know what I mean.

Tips:
- Maintain a common generator file with the keywords to replace
- Mail me at vsn2005@nyu.edu to add features you like
